## NanoTail

The goal of **NanoTail** is to provide a set of functions to manipulate and analyze data coming from polyA lengths estimations done using Oxford Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing and Nanopolish software. The software is still in thee development phase so all suggestions are welcome. Please also expect the code to be changed frequently, so use it with caution.

## Usage

Please use navigation options in the sidebar (located on the left) to access analysis functions and plots. NanoTail currently supports differential adenylation analysis using Wilcoxon and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and differential expression analysis using binomTest from EdgeR. More analysis options are in the development.
